🧪 Experiment 2: SQL Data Analysis with SELECT Clauses

1. Aim & Objective
   To perform complex data retrieval and analysis using advanced SQL clauses. This experiment focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful summaries using aggregation and filtering.
   Key Objectives:
   Master the SELECT statement lifecycle.
   Differentiate between row-level filtering (WHERE) and group-level filtering (HAVING).
   Perform data summarization using Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM).
2. Tools Used
   Database: PostgreSQL 16+
   Interface: pgAdmin 4
   Language: SQL (Structured Query Language)
3. Analysis Workflow
   The experiment utilizes a STUDENTS dataset to perform the following operations:
   • Operation • SQL Clause • Purpose
   • Filtering • WHERE • Filter individual student records based on specific criteria.
   • Grouping • GROUP BY • Categorize records (e.g., grouping students by City).
   • Aggregation • COUNT(), AVG() • Calculate student density and average performance per group.
   • Group Filtering • HAVING • Display only groups meeting a specific threshold.
   • Sorting • ORDER BY • Organize results in ascending or descending order.
4. Procedure
   Data Setup: Create the STUDENTS table and populate it with diverse regional data (Name, City, Marks).
   Aggregation Query: Count the number of students per city.
   Threshold Analysis: Use HAVING to filter groups (e.g., show only cities where the average marks are above 75).
   Reporting: Format the output and sort results to identify top-performing regions.
5. Learning Outcomes
   Data Analysis: Developed the ability to summarize large datasets efficiently.
   Logic Building: Learned to organize output for better business reporting and readability.
   Analytical Skills: Understood how to derive insights from raw data using SQL grouping.
